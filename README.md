**Task1:- Create a code that inputs a number from user and checks if it is odd or even**
    **Explanation of code:-**
                        So here the code inputs a number n from the user and then
                        its uses the mod function that gives the remainder of the division
                        so when the number input by the user is compleatly divied without any remainder
                        it is confirmed that the input number is even else its odd.
                        then it uses if and else branch to finally decide which statement to print.

**Task2:- Create a code which gives the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 50**
**Explanation of code:-**
                    In this code the for loop is used to iterate from 1 to 50 and prior to this a variable sum is initialized to 0
                    then when the loop iterates form 1 to 50 the sum variiable is added to the counter varibale which iterates
                    and then finally the sum is printed 
                    The sum of all the numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
